# Pool Game Simulator
This program was written in C++ for x86_64 Linux systems. It was built using OpenGL libaries, and it runs a physical simulation of a pool table. This was written for a computer graphics course, and it is a heavily modified version of an assignment from that course. 
## Credit
- The code regarding physics simulation and the shaders were written by me
- Some portion of main.cpp, specifically initializing GL, were written by my professor Dr. Daljit Singh Dhillon ([his website](https://djsingh.people.clemson.edu/))
- The project also uses helper functions written by Anton Gerdelan from his [OpenGL 4 Tutorials](https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/)
- Finally, the project uses Sean Barret's image loader ([stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h))
